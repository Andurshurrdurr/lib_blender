# Texturing

After UV mapping the model we are ready to make textures and add them to the material

## Basics
#### Steps
1. Go into texturemode
2. Create a new image from UV map, this will be our texture image, which we can also save externally
3. Grab a brush and start texturing. You can even texture the UV map in texture mode
