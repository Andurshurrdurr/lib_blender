# Blender

Blender is an excellent open source tool for doing everying from 3D models to animation and rendering of these models. Its capabilities in the hands of a trained person is quite astonishing, however the great features and that the software is open source and free comes at the cost of a very steep learning curve.

Due to the availability of the software I at some point downloaded it and tested it and soon overcame many of the high learningcurves in the software. However to not forget the lessons I learned I decided to start writing down things as I worked with Blender. My goals is that I will be even better at blender, enough to use the software to grant a more impressive presentationlayer to my other works.
