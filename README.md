# Personal blender library

Hi and welcome to my personal library for blender 3d. Here I will submit my notes for using blender to create various stuff aswell as models, materials, scripts etc.

Blender is a quite awesome program, and I have been using it on various occasions for everything from creating rendering to animations to show off models. I found it about time I create a structured personal library in a repository for my use of blender.

Feel free to use whatever you find useful here. If youre a great person you will thank me in some way.
